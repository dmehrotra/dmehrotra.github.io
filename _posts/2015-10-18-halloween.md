This week's assignment was to use materials besides plywood and acrylic to make something.  I decided, it being October and all, to make some spooky vampire teeth in honor of the upcoming holliday.

Here is the final product:

I decided to use matt- carving wax to sculpt the vampire teeth.  Ideally I wanted it to be able to fit around your front six teeth like a grill.

The wax was incredibly thick, so cutting through it was pretty difficult.  I suppose I could have used the band saw, but since I was away from the shop ( I was in Bard this weekend for a conference ) I borrowed a friend's spiral wax saw blade/handle. Here are photos of the brick of wax I was dealing with, and the saw:

I drew a vague outline of the shape I was going for on the brick, and began to saw.  It took a while, and made a huge mess. I was using some other wax teeth I had lying around as reference:

I finally sanded and filed away wax to define the teeth.

Currently you can't sink your teeth into them, so I'll need to dig out teeth holes, so it can sit in your mouth. Happy Halloween.
