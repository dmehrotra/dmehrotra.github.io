This week Isabel and I decided to build a computer controlled lazer pointer for our cats.  Ever been tired from a long day at work? So tired that you can't even lift your arms up to play with your cat.  Well now, thanks to miracles in modern technology, you and your cat don't have to worry.  Control your cat's favorite toy while sitting comfortably still on the couch.

This is the schematic:

Building the toy went pretty smoothly. The only trouble we ran into was in the fabrication.  The lazer module we bought ended up being a bit more fragile than we expected, so as we were soldering we ended up desoldering a crucial component.  This wouldn't be that big of a deal if the component wasn't bigger than a grain of sand...but unfortunately, it was tiny; unmeasurably tiny.  So thinking all was lost last night at 11 PM we gave a last ditch effort and tried to solder this tiny piece to the tiny module.  Luckily it worked.  Here's a photo:

I will post a video tonight.
