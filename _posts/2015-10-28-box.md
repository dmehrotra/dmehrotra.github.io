title: Final Faraday Box
category: Intro To Fabrication
---

For my final project I wanted to make something useful.  I came to ITP with the interest in learning tehcnology with regards surveillance, subversion, protest, and disaster relief. 

This Faraday box blocks all radio signals coming in or out of your cellphone. The purpose of this box is to prevent access to your phone and its data (e.g. location) if and when you so choose.

I also wanted to experiment with tools that I was intimidated by, namely, the router and the panel saw.

I had a large piece of plywood, that I cut into more manageable pieces with the panel saw.  John suggested that I use a sacrificial piece of wood to rest my plywood on.  I was really thrilled with how straight the panel saw cut my pieces.

I then lazer cut the outline of my phone so that I had guide for my router.  Once I was satisfied with the guide, I started routing out a place for my phone within the plywood.

I made a huge mess, but it was super fun. You definitely need a respirator when working with a router. 

After I cleaned up the colossal mess I turned the shop into.  I lazer cut some acrylic panels for the cover of the faraday box.  I knew that there would need to be massive amount of tin foil under the acrylic so I went with a dark black color.  I glued tinfoil between the two front acrylic panels, and more under the acrylic piece that sat in the routed area of the wood. I then covered the side of the routed area with copper tape.

I also wanted to make a microphone mute.  For this I essentially trick the android into trying to pull sound from what it believes is an external mic.  In reality, if you snip the top off of some headphones and use a 4.7K resistor and an LED, you can draw enough current from the phone to fool its hardware.
