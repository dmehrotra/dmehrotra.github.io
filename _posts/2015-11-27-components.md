Here is a photo of the major components that I purchased to complete the project. 
<ul>
    <li>
    	<em>USB Battery Pack for Raspberry Pi - 10000mAh - 2 x 5V @ 2A</em>
    	<br>
    	This 50 dollar rechargeable battery pack can power the camera for up to 15 hours before needing to be recharged. Since it was so expensive I am really not trying to have this thing be confiscated. 
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    	<em>Fona/SimCard/Antenna</em><br>
    	To send the photographs from my Pi to the Internet I am using a Fona chip to connect to the internet through a GPRS cellular data connection.  This way I do not need to rely on a wifi connection to post photographs taken by the Pi to a remote server. <br>
    	I bought prepaid T-Mobile sim card without text or call in order to access to GSM network.  
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
    	<em>RaspiCam</em><br>
    	This 30 dollar camera is compatable out of the box with a Raspberry Pi.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li><em>Raspberry Pi</em><br>
    	The raspberry pi is a small and cheap computer that has GPIO capability.  It has higher level functionality than an Arduino.
