I found wiring up the FONA to be incredibly difficult. 
<ul>
    <li>FONA GND to Raspberry Pi ground.</li>
    <li>FONA Vio to Raspberry Pi 3.3 volt power.</li>
    <li>Second 3.7v Battery Ground to FONA Key.</li>
    <li>FONA TX to Raspberry Pi RXD.</li>
    <li>FONA RX to Raspberry Pi TXD.</li>
    <li>Second 3.7v Battery Power to Power<br>
    	This is the jack that supplies power to the fona, not a pin.
     </li>
    <li>Second 3.7v Battery Ground to FONA Key to Ground <br>
    	This is the jack that supplies power to the fona, not a pin.
    </li>
</ul>
I soldered extra long pins to the board to make the wiring process a bit smoother.  I also ended up breaking the power input to the FONA so I needed to solder on some extra pins.  Overall working with the FONA is great, however because the board is so small, I really had to be careful while soldering.

My main problem with regards to wiring up the circuit board was that it took me a long time to figure out that I needed a second battery and I am still unsure why.

Once the FONA is wired up to the PI you need to do quite a bit to ensure that it can speak to the PI. On the Raspberry Pi you need to disable the kernel's use of the hardware serial connection. On older versions of Raspian(The Pi's operating system) you could use a library to automatically stop the bootup process from writing to the serial port by adding lines in the  /etc/inittab library.  However this is impossible on the newer version of Raspian.  To do this I had to do some serious digging.  The answer is this line of code:

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo systemctl stop serial-getty@ttyAMA0.service
{% endhighlight %}  
After I did this, I essentially followed this <a href='https://learn.adafruit.com/fona-tethering-to-raspberry-pi-or-beaglebone-black/setup'>tutorial.</a>

Overall the setup took me about 7 hours, which is 5 hours more than I thought it would.
