I am taking this class because, aside from legos, I have never felt confident building anything physcial.  I never was a boy scout, I didn't take a shop class in high school, my only experiences with power tools have lead to messy clumbsy looking junk.  I work with software, but increasingly I want to be able to network with physcial objects I create.  With that disclaimer, I'm going to tell you about the flashlight I built.  

Being new to ITP I forgot about the importance of documenting each step (it wont happen again), but let me explain how I ended up with a working flashlight.  

Initially I found an LED lightbulb ( and a sweet looking connector) that looked like this:

I thought it was perfect until I realized that it required 120v to light up.  I found that claim particularly dubious, since its just a bunch of led's, so I opened housing up, hoping to find a voltage regulator.... In the process I broke it. 

So lightless, I went to TinkerSphere and bought and 3v led light bulb. I then went to the junk shelf to find switches and a nice housing for my bulb.  

I found this long plastic pipe for th housing that the light bulb might sit well on. I cut it down to size, found a toggle switch. and began to build my circuit. 

The light bulb ended up being just a little too small to simply hot glue to the top of the plastic, so I used the drill press to create a little cylinder cap to mount the light to.  I had to sand this little guy down to the proper size ad we did not have the exact drill bit:

Then I wired my bad boy up and flipped the switch....and nothing happened.  My polairites were wrong on the led bulb....So after that small snag, I tested the circuit, and hot glued my components in place.
