While simultaneously watching Charlie Chaplin’s The Great Dictator and perusing the internet this week, I stumbled across a great print advertisement for a german hat company called Hut Weber.  I find that the ad, besides telling a humorous story, abides by the rules of good design that we talked about last week: simplicity, consistency, and clarity.

Immediately when you look at this ad you receive a punch in the gut.  Hitler is taboo. When people imagine the embodiment of evil, they imagine this brutal dictator. But this isn’t quite Hitler.  His likeness appears from the negative space surrounding his iconic moustache and hair, his brand image. There are no lines defining his face or eyes and his moustache is reduced to a simple trapezoid, but the viewer knows exactly what they are looking at.  

And then you look to the right. The image is repeated, except this time it includes a bowler hat.  Suddenly Hitler stops being Hitler.  He is Charlie Chaplin.  

The story here is simple and is perfectly summed up in the ad’s three words: It’s the hat. 
 
This ad conveys the importance of the hat and uses Hitler, evil’s superlative, to stress it. Everything about the ad is minimal, but it’s implications are huge.  The symmetry, the mundane colors, the sans-serif font all work together to produce a humorous and effective message:  Look how important a hat can be.
